TODO:
We should add some check to validate the player name input. To make sure they don't put the empty string ""
or some invalid characters. 

Check for win/loss conditions per game.
When both games are finished, set lobby state to Ended.

For now, when lobby state is Ended, delete the lobby. Will be changed later to, when Ended, players vote to continue or exit.
Leaving a lobby.
- Host leaves lobby and no one else in lobby, Joiner leaves lobby and host stays, Host leaves lobby and Joiner stays (lobby deletion), Host leaves after game over (lobby deletion), Joiner leaves after game is over.
Look into players leaving the lobby (closing the tab) mid-game. Either can reconnect somehow or lobby is deleted ("Player left game").

Look into web sockets to figure out how to connect both players and show the games concurrently
