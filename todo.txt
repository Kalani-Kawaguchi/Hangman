TODO:
Route(GET)/Handler for getting list of lobbies
Route(POST/PUT)/Handler for making a guess
- Case for correct guess, incorrect guess, duplicate guess, invalid guess

Once both games are created lobby set to ready
once lobby is ready both games will start
Change lobby struct to have game1 and game2
Look into web sockets to figure out how to connect both players and show the games concurrently
